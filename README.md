# BUILD Desktop

Get up ready running Ubuntu or Fedora desktop
*Not perfect, it may break* I will remove this line when I think that each and 
everything works

## How to run
```bash
export DEV_ENV=$(pwd) # I am considering you smart enough
./run
```
> NOTE: I recommend to not set export DEV_ENV=$(pwd) in your bashrc or zshrc
> in order to prevent accidently running it
