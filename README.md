# BUILD Desktop

This is Desktop Building tool (a bunch of scirpts intact together).

Just run a few command and get your desktop up running (in my way ofcourse, 
I am trying to keep the specific things to me in runs folder and all the 
essentials in install).

You can install, or build using the scirpts predefined. 

## Working

This desktop build system has various branches
ex: Fedora42, Ubuntu24.04 

Select your branch and download zip file or clone and switch to desired branch.
running instructions are given in each branch, there are chances of some files 
being same in multiple branches (for now they are seperate, but I am thinking
of changing to keep one universal same file for all the branches).

> Note: we are removing the scripts from the main branch
