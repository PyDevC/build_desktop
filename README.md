# BUILD

This repo is used to quickly setup ubuntu or debian based linux enviornments. 
You can easily run the scripts in scripts directory or run the "run.sh" file

## Run
To run the scripts normally
```bash
./run.sh 
```

If you want to check what is going to happen in this particular scripts
then run this command. 
```bash
./run.sh --dry
```

I will update this so that you can execute different files with different
requirements.

|> Note:  Check the TODO
|> Also The dry run method idea i got from ThePrimeagen
