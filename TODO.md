# TODO

- Create build scripts (if runs or install has any build from soruce then move 
  it to build folder).

- complete rocm setup (for both ubuntu and fedora)
- move rustup from runs to install
- Add redundant scripts for normal installation if it is something essential

- write documentation for `run` -- improve it
