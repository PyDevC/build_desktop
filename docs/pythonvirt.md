# Manage python virtual environment

## How to start

Steps for creating a virtual environment:
- always create virtual environments in ~/personal/env/python (as it is preset for a function)
- python3 -m venv <name>
- use penv to select and activate the environment automatically

## Activate virtual environment

In our .dot files we have a included a function penv in .zsh_profile, which
starts the fzf with all the virtual environments available.
Select any virtual environment and your virtenv is activated.
